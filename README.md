# Bayesian_inference_on_neuroimaging
R code for manuscript "Bayesian inference on comparisons of neurodegeneration over time between healthy ageing and Alzheimer's disease cohorts".

This repository will contain the R code used for the Bayesian mixed effects models, analysis and the three statistical inferences described in the manuscript. For access to the Australian Imaging, Biomarker's and Lifestyle study of ageing (AIBL) data, see http://aibl.csiro.au/research/support/. 
Further background information on the AIBL study see:
Sona, Alessandro, et al. "Predictors of rapid cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: results from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of ageing." International Psychogeriatrics 24.02 (2012): 197-204.

Alternatively, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is another world class ongoing longitudinal study of ageing, whose objectives include making data available to the scientific community without embargo. 
For more information see
Weiner, Michael W., et al. "The Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: A review of papers published since its inception." Alzheimer's & Dementia 8.1 (2012): S1-S68.
For data aquisition details see http://www.adni-info.org/Home.aspx.

In this repository simulated data will be provided to enable users to run the models stated in the manuscript. While results generated from this code will not reflect the true disease pathology/neurodegeneration, it will allow users to familiarise themselves with Bayesian statistical inference methods, which can easily be applied on other applications.
